# Ethereum Execution Specs and Tests Contribution

This project is dedicated to improving the health, maintainability, and efficiency of the [Execution Specs]() and [tests]() for Ethereum clients through targeted code quality enhancements and refactoring efforts. Below are the highlights of my contributions:

## Resolved

* **[Opcodes Variant Sorting](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/pull/957/files):** A comprehensive refactor of the Ops variants within the Ethereum Execution Specs project. The goal was to enhance code readability and maintainability by restructuring and sorting Opcodes variants for each fork in the repository.

* **[Opcodes Variant Sorting for Prague](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/pull/958):** Did the same for the Prague branch.

* **[Unused Imports Cleanup in Test Files](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/pull/916/files):** This task involved the investigation and removal of unused imports within the `tests/*` directory of the Execution Specs project. Identifying and eliminating these redundant imports improved overall readability and maintainability.

* **[`make_receipt` Control Flow Refactor](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/pull/884/files):** This task involved refactoring the control flow in the `make_receipt` function to enhance its coherence and readability. The changes included replacing the `if` statement with `elif` for the `FeeMarketTransaction` type and streamlining the return statements.

* **[Framework Tests and Documentation Update for Solidity v0.8.23](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/pull/373):** This task involved updating the framework tests and documentation of the Ethereum Execution Specs Tests to align with Solidity version 0.8.23. It included modifying existing tests to ensure compatibility with Solidity v0.8.23 and updating the related documentation to reflect the changes and improvements in Solidity v0.8.23.

* **[Further Investigation of Solidity v0.8.23](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/issues/395):** Made further investigation into the alignment of Solidity v0.8.23 with Ethereum Execution Specs Test, most specifically to discover if the commandline Interface: An empty --yul-optimizations sequence can now be always provided.

## In Review

* **[Access List Type Refactor to Improve Code Maintainability](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/pull/960):** The objective of this task involved refactoring the access list type used across various transaction classes to reduce redundancy and enhance maintainability. Key updates included:
  * Creating a new Access class to encapsulate the access list structure, which comprises an account and a tuple of slots (i.e., Tuple[Address, Tuple[Bytes32, ...]])
  * Developing helper functions encode_access_list and decode_access_list to handle the conversion between the new Access type and the previous tuple structure used for RLP encoding and decoding
  * Modifying existing test cases to reflect the new Access class, ensuring that tests continue to validate the correct functionality with the updated type.

* **[Mypy Diagnostics Enhancement](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/pull/984):** I configured `mypy` to enable additional diagnostics for more comprehensive type checking.

* **[Transaction Nonce Type to U64 Update](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/pull/995):** I updated the transaction nonce type from U256 to U64 across each forkâ€™s transaction class in response to EIP-2671.
